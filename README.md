1. **User-Customizable Board Stages:**
   - **Tables:** You would likely need to add a "Stages" table to store custom stage configurations for each board.
   - **API Endpoints:** Add endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting stages. Update the board-related endpoints to accommodate custom stages.

2. **User Comments on Tasks:**
   - **Tables:** Add a "Comments" table to store comments related to tasks.
   - **API Endpoints:** Create endpoints for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting comments on tasks. Update task-related endpoints to include comment functionality.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement consistent error responses with HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).
   - Include informative error messages in the response payload to help users understand issues.
   - Log errors on the server-side for debugging and monitoring.
   - Implement rate limiting and authentication/authorization checks to prevent abuse and unauthorized access.
   - Use validation checks to ensure data integrity and prevent common user errors.
   - Implement user-friendly error messages for common input validation errors (e.g., invalid email format, password too short).
   - Consider adding a global error handling middleware to centralize error management and responses.
